About Our Keynote Speaker



Ix Shen, a former Singaporean actor, is known for his roles in various television series. In 2022, he gained attention for providing first-hand accounts of the Russia-Ukraine war while residing in Kyiv, Ukraine. During this period, he actively participated in humanitarian aid efforts and shared his experiences through social media. 





In February 2023, Shen returned to Singapore to discuss the publication of a memoir detailing his time in Ukraine. This memoir, titled "Impressions of an Invasion: A Correspondent in Ukraine," was released in May 2023 and chronicles his personal experiences during the conflict. This book is a testament to the power of personal growth and transformation even in the midst of chaos.




Through this experience, Ix found himself transformed in profound ways. Grateful for the Ukrainians who aided him during his evacuation from Kyiv, he founded a non-profit organization dedicated to connecting Ukrainian hospitals in need of financial assistance with corporate donors and private sponsors. His initiative facilitates the delivery of essential medical supplies and equipment to these hospitals.

His reflections will offer valuable insights into community building, especially as we celebrate SG60, a momentous milestone, this year.

Title

Beyond the Classroom: Cultivating Eco-Stewards Through Hands-On Learning and Service

Participants 

Both educators and students

Synopsis

In this concurrent session, we will be sharing about our Eco-Stewardship Programme (ESP) at St. Andrew’s Secondary School (SASS), which aims to cultivate environmental responsibility through a structured approach involving curriculum, culture, community, and campus initiatives.

We will begin by outlining the objectives of the ESP in SASS and how its four arms support the enactment of the 4Cs—Curriculum, Culture, Community, and Campus—to foster a sustainable school environment.

Next, we will highlight how Values-in-Action (VIA) serves as the main vehicle for eco-stewardship, both within and beyond the school. Participants will explore hands-on eco-stewardship efforts, such as community litter-picking initiatives, recycling and upcycling activities with primary school students, where students design games using recycled materials. We will emphasize the importance of community engagement throughout this process, fostering leadership and a sense of responsibility among our Saints.

To integrate eco-stewardship meaningfully into the curriculum, we leverage Science to drive authentic learning experiences, particularly through our Science Signature Programme for Lower Secondary students, River Studies. We will showcase digital platforms such as Padlet, SLS, and Google Sites, which facilitate student reflections and knowledge sharing. Additionally, a

hands-on session using Google Lens will demonstrate how technology can enhance biodiversity education.

We will also share how Design Thinking is incorporated into Project Work lessons focused on eco-stewardship and school improvement, highlighting the need for multi-departmental collaboration in fostering a whole-school approach to sustainability.

A key aspect of this session will focus on Community Problem Solving (CmPS), where a core group of students critically engage with social and environmental issues to drive sustained collective action. We will share impactful student-led initiatives, including:
Ang Pow Collection Drive – repurposing red packets to reduce waste
Project Eco Runway – promoting sustainable fashion and creative ways to reuse materials
Project ‘Save Energy Anti-Litter’ (SEAL) – student-led campaigning for school cleanliness
SAJS House Visit – engaging younger students in environmental education
Community Clean-Up Sessions – fostering ownership in maintaining shared spaces

To conclude, we will screen a student-produced video on CmPS initiatives, along with our Green Recruitment video, showcasing how students can take ownership of environmental stewardship. We will also share the structures and systems in place to ensure the sustainability of our efforts.
Through this session, we hope to inspire participants to think critically about social issues, take collective action in their communities, and empower youths to act for a sustainable future.

efficiency. However, the excessive use of digital gadgets and screen time has been shown to cause social displacement and reduction in both well-being and mental health in adolescents (Lua et al. 2023). It is, thus, important to introduce interventions to reverse such trends and to engage individuals in healthy lifestyles. 

Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, schools in Singapore are to fulfil the objectives of the Eco-Stewardship Programme in line with the national agenda for sustainability. It has, hence, become crucial for students to participate in sustainable development activities. One of the ‘R’s activities is to reconnect with nature. Not only does nature connectedness boost the student’s awareness in environmental sustainability, it also helps them to appreciate the ecosystem services at greater depth and allows the students to make informed decisions in tackling rising issues from environmental impacts and climate change. 

In this workshop, the speaker, who is also an educator in various Institutes of Higher Learning, will share some of her past experiences and the different ways to reconnect students with the nature, while fulfilling the school curriculum. Hosted by Dr Cynthia Wong from The Good Earth School, participants will learn how to design meaningful and fun programmes that can inspire and empower the younger generation.

From Sympathy to Empathy: Facilitating Transformation for Student into Future Community Builders

Participants 

Both educators and students

Synopsis

Values-in-Action (VIA) is more than just community service—it is a journey that shapes the mindset and character of students, preparing them to be future changemakers in Singapore. This workshop explores how VIA experiences influence student volunteers, moving them from sympathy toward social issues to deeper empathy, fostering a sustained commitment to community building.

To create truly transformative experiences, VIA must go beyond structured activities to empower student voices and cultivate ownership. As students' progress from observing social issues to forming personal connections, they become more inclined to take initiative in meaningful ways. Educators play a crucial role in this process—not just as facilitators but as partners who share a common goal with students. By fostering student-led initiatives and supporting reflective learning, teachers can create an environment where students feel inspired to sustain their involvement and contribute to lasting community impact.
This session hopes to facilitate conversations that will connect these insights to the future, considering how today’s student —when supported and empowered—can grow into future leaders who drive meaningful, long-term change in Singapore’s social landscape.
